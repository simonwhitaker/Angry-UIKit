# Angry UIKit

A UIKit Dynamics demonstration app for use in my presentation at [Alt Tech Talks London 2013](http://london.alttechtalks.com). The slides are available [on Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/simonwhitaker/introduction-to-uikit-dynamics).

This is a fun, frivolous example with simple, bold views and animations that show up well on a projection screen. As stated in the talk you should **never use UIKit Dynamics for physics-based games**, or kittens might die.
